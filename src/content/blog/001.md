Although I am in touch with various web technologies every single day, I struggled what to pick for my personal blog.

Initially I thought of building a blog website using [htmx](https://htmx.org) under the hood. But setting up a backend with a database
seemed overkill.
Pagebuilders like [Webflow](https://webflow.com) would have been great from a design point of view, and yet they don't demonstrate my
development skills.

Not wanting to use pagebuilders, I also avoided [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), since I wanted my blog to be an opportunity to
learn a new technology. Hence, it must be created with a technology I have no experience in. I stumbled
upon [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), but it didn't fit. Then [Astro](https://astro.build) came across. As soon as I discovered their
markdown template, I knew I am going with Astro.

Here are some of the criteria I made my decision on:

- load speed, [lightning fast](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-alexanderbetz-com/t9go4fcd2j?form_factor=mobile) ⚡️
- a subtly nuanced template, like old money luxuries ✨
- versioned 🔒
- of course, responsive 📱
- neither ORM or SQL, nor a database 🚫
