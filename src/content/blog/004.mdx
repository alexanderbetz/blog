Upfront, till now I hate writing. I think a lot, but I rarely write something down. And when I do, all those sheets of paper are a mess and get thrown away eventually.

This blog is intended to be a slightly better way of storing my thoughts and experiences, precisely by not messing up my desk.

There is a german saying which goes like this:
> Wer schreibt, der bleibt.

Which essentially means, **only the written word counts**. This might be my primary motivation to do this.

By writing you can always keep track of things. Some might also say, writing is the foundation of improving themselves.

It's an important skill. Writing and especially publishing it creates presence, which further builds trust. And we all know that every sale builds on trust. So this blog is a clear **investment into myself**. And I'd recommend you to do the same thing.
