Ever saw an import like this?

```typescript
import { t, locale } from '@deckweiss/internationalization'
```

Usually you would expect that there exists and `index.js` file within the package directory, and there often does. This file is called *barrel file*, since it re-exports all publicly available source code.

There is one specific scenario which does not really make any sense. When using typescript as a package developer, you have to import all files into your *barrel file* with a `.js` extension. Otherwise probably nobody is able to import your code and they will get weird error messages.

Below you find some dos and don'ts.
```typescript
// index.ts in your npm package

// Do
export * from 'translate.js'

// Do
import { t } from 'translate.js'
export { t }

// Don't
export * from 'translate'
// or
export * from 'translate.ts'

// Don't
import { t } from 'translate'
export { t }
```

Even this little detail in package development did take me a couple hours to fix. If it did help you, feel free leaving a reaction.
